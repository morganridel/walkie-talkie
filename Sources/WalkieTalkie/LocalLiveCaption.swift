/// **Live captions from the local model** (2026-10-05). the original author: *"Pe stilul

/// local … un fel de sliding window. Aceste window-uri să le trimiți atunci când
/// fac o pauză în vorbire … de jumătate de secundă"*, then *"în niciun caz nu

///
/// - **When**: a pause of `pause` (0.5 s of the meter's own quiet) after new
///   speech, or every `steadyEvery` while he talks on without one.
/// - **What**: the take from `anchor` to where the voice stopped (+ `tail`),
///   copied out of memory (`MicRecorder.takeSlice`) — never the trailing
///   silence, which is where Whisper invents sentences.
/// - **Window size is free up to 30 s** — Whisper pads every window to 30 s, so
///   a 3 s window costs what a 20 s one does (his own decodes on this Mac:
///   median 1.24 s at 3–6 s of audio, 1.65 s at 6–10, 1.68 s at 20–60). The
///   window is cut only when it nears `maxWindow`.
/// - **What stays fixed**: a segment two decodes in a row agree on, ending at
///   least `LiveAgreement.settle` before the voice stopped, is committed and the
///   window starts after it (`LiveAgreement`, LocalAgreement on Whisper's own
///   segments — no word timings, which cost +45 %).
/// - **Its own helper** (`LocalWhisper(live: true)`, a second copy of the
///   weights): at the close a window still decoding is **SIGKILLed** and the
///   final decode runs on the sentence's helper, alone. A signal-raised cancel
///   inside one helper was measured first and did not do it — MLX held the
///   interpreter for up to 0.7 s, a whole decode. The killed helper comes back
///   after the sentence's words have landed (`warmLater`).
